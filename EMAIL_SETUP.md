# Email Monitoring Setup

## What's Added:
Your `simple_automation.py` now includes email notifications for:
- **Success** - When automation completes successfully
- **Failure** - When automation fails

## Setup (2 minutes):

### **Step 1: Update Email Settings**
Open `simple_automation.py` and find lines 51-56:

```python
'sender_email': 'your_email@gmail.com',
'sender_password': 'your_app_password',
'recipient_emails': [
    'your_email@gmail.com',      # Your email
    'manager@company.com'        # Manager's email
]
```

### **Step 2: Gmail App Password (if using Gmail)**
1. Go to Google Account Settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Go to Security > App passwords
4. Generate password for "Mail"
5. Use this 16-character password (not your regular password)

### **Step 3: Test**
```bash
python simple_automation.py
```

## Email Notifications:

**Success Email:**
- Subject: "Freight Logistics Automation - SUCCESS"
- Shows: Steps completed, duration, dashboard status

**Failure Email:**
- Subject: "Freight Logistics Automation - FAILED"  
- Shows: Failed steps, troubleshooting tips

## If Email Not Configured:
- Automation still works normally
- Just skips email notifications
- Logs: "Email not configured - skipping notification"

## For Company Handover:
- Update email settings with company email
- Manager receives monthly success/failure notifications
- Professional monitoring system

**That's it! Your automation now has professional email monitoring!**
